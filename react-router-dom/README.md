# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# important
 # what is the difference between using Link tag and "<a>" tag...
    <p>When we use "<a>" tag whole page gets refreshed which we don't want because when the page is refreshed it prints the new snapshot of the dom. which takes more time...This makes our webpages rendering time more....When we use Link tag it does not refresh the page which cause fast execution and real implementation of the react js.</p>
